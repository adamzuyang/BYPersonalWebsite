# Barnett Yang Personal Portfolio and Pathfinding Visualizer

This online portfolio that hosts my resume, Medium blog, and pathfinding visualizer. This website was created using Node.js, Bootstrap, Javascript, and the EJS template engine.

The visualizer features Dijkstra's, A*, Greedy, BFS, DFS, and bidirectional algorithms and makes use of heuristics to generate different search patterns. The visualizer is interactive, allowing the user to add walls, weighted nodes, and utilize a recursive random maze generator. This project was created in conjunction with my personal portfolio and uses Node.js, Bootstrap, and Javascript. Animations were created with CSS.
