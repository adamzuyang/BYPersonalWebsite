# Barnett Yang Personal Portfolio and Pathfinding Visualizer

This online portfolio that hosts my resume, Medium blog, pathfinding visualizer, and sorting visualizer. This website was created using Node.js, Bootstrap, Javascript, and the EJS template engine. The JSON files used for the template engine are located at `./json`

The pathfinding visualizer features Dijkstra's, A*, Greedy, BFS, DFS, and bidirectional algorithms and makes use of heuristics to generate different search patterns. The visualizer is interactive, allowing the user to add walls, weighted nodes, and utilize a recursive random maze generator. This project was created in conjunction with my personal portfolio and uses Node.js, Bootstrap, and Javascript. Animations were created with CSS.
